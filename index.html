	<h1>Mindstorms</h1>
	<p>Seymour Papert’s Mindstorms was published in 1980, and outlines his vision of children using computers as instruments for learning. A second edition, with new Forewords by John Sculley and Carol Sperry, was published in 1993. The book remains as relevant now as when first published almost forty years ago. We invite you to add your comments and reflections.</p>

	<p>The Media Lab is grateful to Seymour Papert’s family and to the publisher of Mindstorms, Basic Books, for allowing us to post the text here. We also thank the MIT Libraries, The MIT Press, and Travis Rich for their assistance in pulling everything together. </p>

	<p>If you are interested in purchasing the print edition of Mindstorms, copies of the book are <a href="http://www.basicbooks.com/full-details?isbn=9780465046744">available from Basic Books</a>.</p>
